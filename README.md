Closure Tree
============

Closure Tree is a mostly-API-compatible replacement for the
acts_as_tree and awesome_nested_set gems, but with much better
mutation performance thanks to the Closure Tree storage algorithm.

See [Bill Karwin](http://karwin.blogspot.com/)'s excellent 
[Models for hierarchical data presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data)
for a description of different tree storage algorithms.
